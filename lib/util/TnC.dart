Third party applications


Through the Uturn Jobs API it is possible for users to grant third party applications access to their Uturn Jobs  account. Depending on the permissions that are granted, these applications may be able to access some personal information or do actions on the users' behalf. These third party applications are not controlled by us and will be governed by their own privacy policy. Users are able to remove third party applications from access their data through their settings.
Other disclosures and transfers
We may also disclose your personal information to third parties for the following purposes:
if necessary to provide the service or product you have requested;
we receive court orders, subpoenas or other requests for information by law enforcement;
if otherwise permitted or required by law; or
for other purposes with your consent.
As we are a growing global company, with offices growing around the world, your personal information may be processed by staff in any of our offices. Uturn Jobs currently has offices in India.
Accessing, correcting, or downloading your personal information
You have the right to request access to the personal information Uturn Jobs holds about you. Unless an exception applies, we must allow you to see the personal information we hold about you, within a reasonable time period, and without unreasonable expense for no charge. Most personal information can be accessed by logging into your account. If you wish to access information that is not accessible through the platform, or wish to download all personal information we hold on you in a portable data format, please contact our Privacy Officer.
You also have the right to request the correction of the personal information we hold about you. All your personal information can be updated through the user settings pages. If you require assistance please contact our customer support.
Exercising your other rights
You have a number of other rights in relation to the personal data Uturn Jobs holds about you, however, there may be restrictions on how you may exercise the rights. This is largely due to the nature of the products and services we provide. Much of the data we collect is in order to facilitate contracts between users, facilitate payments, and provide protection for the legitimate users of our marketplace - these data uses are protected against the below rights.
You have the right to:
seek human review of automated decision-making or profiling
opt-out of direct marketing, and profiling for marketing
erasure
temporary restriction of processing.
Human review of automated decision making / profiling - In the case of our ranking algorithms, it is not possible to exercise this right as this ranking is a fundamental part of the marketplace that users participate in, opting out would mean not being able to participate in the marketplace. Decisions affecting marketplace security are already reviewed by humans.
Direct marketing and profiling - users can control what emails they receive through their settings page.
Erasure - Most personal information and user generated content cannot be deleted as they are used to support contracts between users, document financial transactions, and are used in providing protecting other legitimate users of the marketplace. In the case of non-personal data that can be linked with personal data, it will either be erased or otherwise anonymised from the personal data.
Temporary restriction to processing - under certain circumstances you may exercise this right, in particular if you believe that the personal data we have is not accurate, or you believe that we do not have legitimate grounds for processing your information. In either case you may exercise this right by contacting our privacy officer.
Unless stated above, users may exercise any of the above rights by contacting our Privacy Officer.
